    Hi.    The Portuguese (Brazil) word list, in BR.dic file, was    generated using the ISPELL spell checker, and its Brazilian    package, maintained mainly by Ricardo Ueda <ueda@ime.usp.br>.    In GPL, BR.dic can be distributed, but have to be FREE.The credits for the creation of this word list goes to Sadao Massago <smassago@icmc.sc.usp.br>The credits for ISPELL can be found at the ISPELL home page <fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/ficus-members/geoff/ispell.html >The credits for the Brazilian package for ISPELL can be found at <http://www.ime.usp.br/~ueda/br.ispell>For further information, read the section on "How To GenerateWord Lists" below...    Have a nice day.    Miguel Vinicius Santini Frasson=============================================================  How to generate word lists using the ISPELL spell checker.=============================================================You can get ispell from http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/ficus-members/geoff/ispell.html* Required files   - ispell (of course)   - radicals file   - affixs fileThe dictionary file (.hash or .has) of ispell is generated bybuildhas program, using the radicals file (without a defaultextension) and the affixs file (.aff). The buildhas command line is  bulidhas [radicals file] [affixs file .aff] [dictionary file .has]Look at README file to see what is the radicals file.With the .has (or .hash) and .aff files in hand, you can generate theword list by the command line:(UNIX)  cat [radical] | ispell -e -d [dictionary] | tr " " "\n"  |sort| uniq > [wordlist]where:  [radical]    -> path and name of the radicals file.  [dictionary] -> path and name of the .has (or .hash) file.  [wordlist]   -> path and name of the word list file.  tr " " "\n"  -> replaces the spaces by a "new line" character.  uniq         -> eliminates repeated lines.(DOS)  type [radical] | ispell -e -d [dictionary] > [wordlist]Under Dos, you get list of words, but with similar words in thesame line. You can do a simple program to replace spaces by a"new line" command. You have to use WinEdt' Sort Lines dialog(Tools menu) to sort as WinEdt dictionary and remove repeatedwords.This method of obtaining word lists is based in the makefile includedin the Portuguese ispell dictionary source distributed by  http://www.ime.usp.br/~ueda/br.ispell/
